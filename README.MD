<h3>To keep the development going of KPO, <a href="https://www.paypal.me/MariusSucan/15">please donate</a> using PayPal. Or you can check the commercial edition on the <a href="https://keypressosd.com/"">official site</a> and <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/keypressosd/discount">buy it from Gumroad</a>.</h3>

<p>The commercial edition is a much newer version and it has changed considerably compared to the freeware edition available here. The quality of the freeware edition is <em>very poor</em> compared to the commercial one. It is much faster and optimized. It also has many bug fixes, better support for typing in foreign scripts and more features. </p>

<h2>Project description</h2>

<p>This program is an On-Screen Display or a Heads-Up Display for keys. It displays every key or mouse button press at a clearly visible text size. I developed it for people like me, with poor eye sight or low vision. It is meant to aid desktop computer usage. It is especially useful while chatting or for occasional typing. The user no longer has to squint at the screen or zoom in the entire screen to see what s/he wrote for every text field.</p>

<p>This application can also be used for screen casts or presentations, by disabling the typing mode at Preferences. In its main menu, you can select Quick Start Presets to help you get started.</p>

<p>Numerous unique features, options and settings are available in the different Preferences windows provided in the program, such that everyone can find a way to adapt it to personal needs.</p>

<p>This application has support for Cyrillic and Latin-based keyboard layouts. I also did some limited testing with Indic  layouts, e.g., Bengali, and as far as I can tell, KeyPress OSD works with these as well.</p>

<p>In recent versions, I implemented partial support for Right-to-Left [RTL] keyboard layouts, such as Arabic. Caret navigation is disabled for such layouts.</p>

<p>I did not test or developed this application having in mind support for Chinese or Japanese scripts. It would be too complex for me to implement support for such writing systems. On Windows, to type in such languages one makes use of IMEs [Input Method Editors] - additional typing aids that facilitate input of non-Latin texts using Latin keyboards.</p>

<p>If other programmers are willing to invest time in this application and to extend it, are welcomed to do so. Anyone is free to transform it into anything they wish. The source code is available. However, keep in mind, I am no programmer. I learned to code by developing this application. The code quality is definitely poor :-).</p>

<p>I coded the application as an <a href="https://autohotkey.com/">AHK script</a> for AutoHotkey_H v1.1.27. To execute/compile the source code one needs <a href="https://hotkeyit.github.io/v2/">AutoHotkey_H v1.1+</a>.</p>
<p>Through the development of this project, Drugwash (from the <a href="https://autohotkey.com/boards/">AHK forums</a>) substantially contributed with code and feedback. Many thanks to you!</p>
<p>In addition, many thanks for the great support and help to the people on #ahk (irc.freenode.net) and from the AHK forum.</p>
